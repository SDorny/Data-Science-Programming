import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=FutureWarning)

```

```{python}
#| label: project data

```


## QUESTION|TASK 2

_In VS Code, write a python script to create the example Altair chart from section 3.2.2 of the textbook (part of the assigned readings). Note that you have to type chart to see the Altair chart after you create it._

```{python}
#| label: Q1 chart
#| code-summary: plot example
#| fig-cap: "My useless chart"
#| fig-align: center
# Include and execute your code here

chart = (alt.Chart(mpg).mark_circle()
  .encode(
    x='displ', 
    y='hwy')
  
)

chart
```

## QUESTION|TASK 3

__Your final report should also include the markdown table created from the following (assuming you have mpg from question 2).__

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
print(mpg
  .head(5)
  .filter(["manufacturer", "model","year", "hwy"])
  .to_markdown(index=False))
```
