## Practice Coding Challenge

### Name: _Sarah Dorny_

### Instructions

_In the Final Coding Challenge I will ask you to complete problems about as challenging as what is shown below.  Plus, you will need to fit a machine learning model with data I provide._

_Remember, you will only have 60 minutes to work on the challenge! You will not be able to complete every question perfectly, but you should spend at least a little time on each question._

_Paste your answers and code inside this `.qmd` file._


### Practice Challenges

Start by loading these packages and data:

```{python}

import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
import numpy as np
alt.data_transformers.enable("vegafusion")

dat = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4missing/raw/master/data-raw/mtcars_missing/mtcars_missing.csv')

```

<br>

**Question 1:** Try recreating the chart below using the [mtcars missing](https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4missing/raw/master/data-raw/mtcars_missing/mtcars_missing.csv) data that you've already loaded.

- Note that `hp` has missing values, and you will have to replace them with the mean.
- Please drop all cars with a missing name.

**Question 1 Answer:**

_Show your chart here._

**Question 1 Code:**

```{python}
# Replacing missing values with the mean
dat['hp'] = dat['hp'].fillna(dat['hp'].mean())

# Drop cars with a missing name
cleandat = dat.dropna(subset=['car'])

cleandat
```

```{python}
# Chart
range_ = ['red']

chart1 = alt.Chart(
    cleandat,
    title=alt.Title(                                    # Title of Graph
        "This is awesome." )).mark_circle(size=60, color='red').encode(
    alt.X('hp').title('HorsePower'),
    alt.Y('mpg').title('HorsePower')`
).interactive()

chart1

```
<br>

**Question 2:** Try writing code to recreate the following table.

- Have `cyl` on the rows and `carb` on the columns
- The values inside the table represent the number of cars with that particular `cyl`/`carb` combination.
- The `pd.crosstab()` function could be helpful, or maybe `pd.pivot_table()`.


|   cyl |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   6 |   8 |
|------:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
|     4 |   5 |   6 |   0 |   0 |   0 |   0 |
|     6 |   2 |   0 |   0 |   4 |   1 |   0 |
|     8 |   0 |   4 |   3 |   6 |   0 |   1 |

**Question 2 Answer:**

_Show your table here._

**Question 2 Code:**

```{python}
# Creates a pivot table dataframe 
table = pd.pivot_table(dat, values =['cyl'], columns =['carb']) 
# table = pd.crosstab(cleandat, ['cyl'], rownames=['cyl'], colnames=['carb']) 
table 

```

**Additional Questions:** On the Final Coding Challenge, I will also ask you to fit a Machine Learning Model. There may be 1-2 additional questions.
